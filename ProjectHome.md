Titled Euclide, from the alleged Greek author of Les éléments, an outstanding treatise of geometry displaying great deduction skills from its author(s), the program is currently available in beta version somewhere on Internet. The author, whose name is yet unknown, seems to be interested only in the underlying algorithm since we have been told that the program is not much flexible in terms of memory usage and options. Rumors talk of a hefty 56Mb of memory! One of our source even discredits the author for he perceived the user interface as a mere revamp of Natch's one.
Pascal Wassong recently admitted to a friend that these persistent rumors gave him fresh motivation to further improve his already excellent program. In conclusion, we think that whether Euclide is real or is only a rumor, it certainly will have a positive impact on computer problem solving.
